# User Interview

## Instructions
read `SPEC.md` in this project folder and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious.
Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file
